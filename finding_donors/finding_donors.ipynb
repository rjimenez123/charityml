    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "![GaussianNB_Algo](imgs/Gaussian-Naive-Bayes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "Since it assumes independence between the features of the model, the 'curse of dimentionality' does not affect it.\n",
    "Another good characteristic of NB classifiers is that they make the correct Maximum A Posteriori rule, this means that give us the correct prediction for the class that is most probable to be given the values of the features given.\n",
    "Finally NB classifiers don't need a lot of observations to accurately predict the classes, and is very robust, meaning that they are not affected too much by outliers, and the training process is very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "Especifically this type of NB classifier, Gaussian, also assumes that the continuous features are normally distributed. This might be a problem if our features don't meet that especification. Although we can make some transformations(standard Scaler & quantile transformations), these calculations might be efficiently slow and not cost-performance worthy.\n",
    "The probability estimations of each class might be even grossly wrong, so the output predict_proba should not be taken seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real World Application:\n",
    "An interesting real example application that came to my mind while reading about this ML model is to predict the biological sex of a pacient in a hospital given his medical history. This might be really important since it is ever more common not to give away that information, but sometimes in order for the doctors to make the best presciption given your symptoms, they need that information.\n",

    "# AdaBoost\n",
    "![AdaBoost_Algo](imgs/adaboost.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "The AdaBoost learning algorithm is a group of so called weak learners, which we can pick the weak learners' learning algorthim, and each of them focuses on the observations that the past learners couldn't classify correctly. This is way better than the random forest approach where every decision tree, for example, focuses only on a few features or a subset of the training data.\n",
    "Another strength of Adaboost is that each weak learner only focuses on the features proven to improve the predictive power of the model(tree stumps instead of a full decision tree), reducing the possibility to fall into the curse of dimensionality and also improves the training and prediction times since we only have to evaluate a subset of the whole set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "Sadly for us, Adaboost was initially created to solve binary classification problems, and so it needs adaptation to be able to classify multiple classes. And although we already have it implemented on sklearn(Python), it is a bit more complicated to understand the model.\n",
    "It is also sensitive to outliers/noise presence in the data, since the input of each weak learner is the output of a previous learner, and then we can increase indefinitely the error of an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real World Application:\n",
    "There are multiple applications for this type of learning algorithms, specially in the competitive data science sector, where we can obtain easy and fast thresholds, since it is based on stumps and hence makes a kind of implicit feature engineering. \n",

    "By looking at the F-score we can already conclude that Adaboost and SVC are better than the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. So let's focus on those two. <br>\n",
    "First of all, we can see that the F1 score improves more in the Adaboost algo compared to SVC, indicating that the generalization is achieved better in the former learning algo. And in general we get better results in both metrics for the Adaboost algorithm. <br>\n",
    "As discussed previously, SVM are not as explainable as the Adaboost models, and since we get better results with the Adaboost anyways, there is no reason to choose SVM. Also, the training and prediction times are way more slower with the support vector machines. <br><br>\n",
    "In conclusion, the Adaboost algorithm gets better predictions in less time, and in the end, we get a more explainable model than the SVM one since Adaboost works with tree stumps(we can see which feature decided the cut in the data)."

    "**Note:** <i>I tried to give my answer as if I, as a data scientist working for CharityML, was explaining my model in a presentation in front of the stake-holders, product owner, bussiness people in general, etc. Hence I was not too technical about some terminology, for example saying that my model got ~75% accuracy, instead of mentioning that it was in fact the f-beta score with beta equal to 0.5</i>\n",

    "Right now, CharityML is reaching to thousands of working people in California without actually knowing if a response will follow. As we can see, there is a need to reduce the overhead cost of sending mails; specially in the long run, when we migth think to expand our barriers and send mails to working people not just in California but all the states.<br>\n",
    "Having this in mind, we decided to create a model that will help us make the decision wether we should send a mail to a person or not, taking into account that every donation received so far (history of 32k mails) has been from people with an income greater than 50k a year. Thus, our goal is to correctly identify people with that earnings greater than 50k.<br>\n",
    "To overcome this problem, we decided to first test 3 possible models that have been succesful in the past in similar problems. After running some simulations, we found that our model Adaboost is the best match for us taking only a fraction of a second to process all the data (\\~45k people analyzed) and getting the best performance over all 3 models(\\~75% accuracy).<br>\n",
    "It is worth noting that the metric we chose was primarily focusing more on not failing rather than detecting as much as people with a high income as possible; meaning that our model will tell us that a person has an income greater than 50k when it is pretty confident of its prediction. This decision was taken so we don't was money sending unfruitful emails.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to mention that in addition to just pointing out who has an income higher than 50k, we can also ask our model to tell us how confident he is about every specific prediction. For example, if I were to ask it to predict my income, it might answer for example: \"Your predicted income is 45k with 88% confidence\".<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I conclude this presentation I would like to mention future enhancements that we could make to the model in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could take all the people with predicted incomes higher than 50k and separate them in 3 groups and assigning them a color between red, yellow and green. Green meaning that we are at least 90% confident about our prediction, yellow if our model is 80%-90% confident and red if it is less than 80%. Depending on the budget, one month we could decide to just send mails to the green predictions, and if we have a bigger budget we might even send mails to the yellow ones, for example. This could be availabe in a dashboard.\n",
    "- We used data from a census taken in 1996, more than 20 years ago, so we could give our model updated info and adding more info that could help us improve the model's performance; for example, the zone in which a person lives, or his/her current position and company from his/her linked-in profile, etc.\n",

    "About age and hours-per-week I was totally wrong, I assumed that those features wouldn't play a big role in determining the income, since I thought that the majority in California would work 8hours and that a lot of innovation would make irrelevant the age of the workers. I missed the part that there might be a lot of independent people that don't make as much as other people, and also the data is from 1996, this makes my assumption about innovation null. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
